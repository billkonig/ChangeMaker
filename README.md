# ChangeMaker
Program to take user input (number from 0-99, representing change needed less than a dollar) and give the output in how many quarters, 
dimes, nickels, and pennies would be returned to equal the amount of change needed, using as few coins as possible.  Only coins needed are 
listed in output (e.g. if no quarters are needed, output will not read "quarters: 0", instead, the "quarters" field will be omitted).
